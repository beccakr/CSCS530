      "# Emerald Ash Borer ABM\n",
      "### Midterm Checkpoint: March 20, 2015\n",
      "### Becca Robinson\n",
      "* Course ID: CMPLXSYS 530\n",
      "* Course Title: Computer Modeling of Complex Systems\n",
      "* Term: Winter, 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "### Goal \n",
      "We will examine the effect of tree density, tree health, and biodiversity on the spread-rate of the Emerald Ash Borer. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Justification\n",
      "Given the variable behavior and life stages of the Emerald Ash Borer and the importance of spatial considerations when modeling their behavior, an ABM methodology is necessary. A Differential Equations approach would not be prudent in this case, given the relatively stochastic ways in which the Ash Borer is introduced and subsequently spreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Processes & Mechanisms of Interest\n",
      "In this model, I am primarily interested in the effects of tree density, tree health, and biodiversity on the spread-rate of the Emerald Ash Borer. To measure these effects, this model considers the length of time it takes for the entire tree population in the study area to be infected and killed by the Emerald Ash Borer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Outline\n",
      "### 1) Space\n",
      "In this model, the space will be a 2D square grid without wrapping edges. Each grid cell will contain zero or one tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2) Actors\n",
      "\n",
      "#### a) Beetles\n",
      "Beetles are the main agent in this model which will spread outward from a randomly chosen focal point and degrade tree health to the point that the tree is killed. This model simulates their life cycle by stepping them through their life stages from egg to larvae to adult to dormant. Because reproduction is my main concern, I will only model female beetles. \n",
      "#### Properties\n",
      "* _lifestage_: What stage of life the beetle is in\n",
      "    * 1 = egg\n",
      "    * 2 = larvae\n",
      "    * 3 = dormant\n",
      "    * 4 = adult\n",
      "* _num_eggs_: the number of female eggs laid by a given female. Typical range is between 50 and 90 according to literature cited in proposal. Therefore, num_eggs will be based on a randomly sampling a uniform distribution between 25 and 45 (dividing by 2 to simulate only females). \n",
      "* _egg_survival_: this represents the probability that an egg becomes a larvae.\n",
      "* _winter_survival_: this represents the probability that a dormant lavae becomes an adult.\n",
      "* _wanderlust_: how far an adult beetle is willing to look for a new host tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "For their step function, beetles actions will vary depending on life stage:\n",
      "* _Eggs_: Check _egg_survival_ to see whether egg becomes larvae or not.\n",
      "* _Larvae_ will feed on their host tree (degrading its health) and then become adults. If the host tree is unable to support it, the larvae will die.\n",
      "* _Dormant_ beetles will become adults. Some will not survive. \n",
      "* _Adults_ will search within their neighborhood (defined by _wanderlust_) for a new host tree. If they find one, they will lay eggs on it. Then they will die. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### b) Trees\n",
      "Trees are the other agent in this model. They will grow and die according to their interactions with beetles.\n",
      "#### Properties\n",
      "* _species_: whether the tree is an ash tree (and therefore a target) or not. \n",
      "* _tree_dbh_: the size (diameter at breast height) of the tree. This will affect how many larvae it can host.\n",
      "* _tree_health_: the health of the tree on a scale from 1 (perfectly healthy) to 0 (dead). \n",
      "* _has_beetles_: whether or not the tree is a host. This will only apply to ash trees, as other trees in the system will not be affected. \n",
      "* _num_eggs_: the number of female beetle eggs.\n",
      "* _num_larvae_: the number of female larva.\n",
      "* _num_dormant_: the number of female dormant beetles.\n",
      "* _num_adult_: the number of female adult beetles.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their step function, the following will update:\n",
      "* Trees will grow based on their health. If they are currently hosting beetles, they will not grow at all, but if they are not hosts, a nominal amount will be added to _tree_dbh_. \n",
      "* _tree_health_ will decline based on the number of adults/larvae on a given tree. This decline will be small in the presence of adults (they only defoliate the tree) but larger for each larvae present. Eventually, the tree will die. \n",
      "* If a previously unaffected tree becomes infested, _has_beetles_ will be updated. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Institutions\n",
      "At this time, this model has no institutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Initial Conditions\n",
      "### Trees\n",
      "* Trees will randomly be placed on a grid by sampling from a uniform discrete distribution with replacement. If we choose a cell that has already been chosen, we'll keep trying until we place all our trees.\n",
      "* Trees will then be assigned a species - randomly chosen trees from our population will become ash trees. \n",
      "* Trees will have their health randomly initialized to a value from a uniform continuous distribution between .85 and 1 (the majority of trees will be healthy at the outset). \n",
      "* Trees will have their size randomly initialized based on a uniform continuous distribution. \n",
      "* All trees will, by default, have no beetles. One will be randomly chosen to be infected with one adult. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Beetles\n",
      "* One adult beetle will be placed on one ash tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above description, we need the following:\n",
      "* _grid_size_: the size of our square 2D grid (i.e. square length)\n",
      "* _tree_population_: the total number of trees in our system.\n",
      "* _ash_prop_: the percentage of the tree population that is an ash species and therefore, susceptible. \n",
      "* _min_dbh_: the minimum dbh for trees.\n",
      "* _max_dbh_: the maximum dbh for trees. \n",
      "* _min_health_: the minimum health of a tree (0.85)\n",
      "* _max_health_: the maximum health of a tree (1) \n",
      "* _min_growth_: the minimum growth/timestep for a tree\n",
      "* _max_growth_: the maximum growth/timestep for a tree\n",
      "* _initial_beetles_: the number of beetles in the system at timestep 1. This defaults to 1. \n",
      "* _min_egg_survival_, _max_egg_survival_: the range of possible values of egg survival rates - varies between 0 and 1.\n",
      "* _min_winter_survival_, _max_winter_survival_: the range of possible values for winter survival rates - varies between 0 and 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Parameter Sweep Details\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to answer my question, I'll sweep tree density, tree health, and biodiversity (*tree_population*, *min_/max_tree_heath*, and *prop_ash*, respectively) to see how the Ash Borer spread rate is affected. Tree health will affect the length of time it takes for an ash borer infestation to kill a tree, and tree density/the proportion of ash trees will affect the ease with which the adult ash borers can find a suitable host. The model run for each set of parameters will stop once all ash trees in the study area (grid) have been killed. Then the number of timesteps that occurred will be counted and divided by four to quantify the number of years it took for the ash borer to decimate the ash population. By comparing these numbers, we can begin to see which factors affect Ash Borer spread rate, which could lead to management recommendations. \n",
