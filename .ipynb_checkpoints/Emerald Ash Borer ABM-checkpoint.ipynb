      "# Emerald Ash Borer ABM\n",
      "### Final Model: April 28, 2015\n",
      "### Becca Robinson\n",
      "* Course ID: CMPLXSYS 530\n",
      "* Course Title: Computer Modeling of Complex Systems\n",
      "* Term: Winter, 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "### Goal \n",
      "We will examine the effect of tree density, tree health, and biodiversity on the spread-rate of the Emerald Ash Borer. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Justification\n",
      "Given the variable behavior and life stages of the Emerald Ash Borer and the importance of spatial considerations when modeling their behavior, an ABM methodology is necessary. A Differential Equations approach would not be prudent in this case, given the relatively stochastic ways in which the Ash Borer is introduced and subsequently spreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Processes & Mechanisms of Interest\n",
      "In this model, I am primarily interested in the effects of tree density, tree health, and biodiversity on the spread-rate of the Emerald Ash Borer. To measure these effects, this model considers the length of time it takes for the entire ash tree population in the study area to be infected and killed by the Emerald Ash Borer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Outline\n",
      "### 1) Space\n",
      "In this model, the space will consist of two grids: a 2D square grid (sized according to initial parameters) without wrapping edges, housing the trees (based on their tree_id) and a corresponding array of lists housing the beetle_ids. The locations in each grid will correspond, meaning that the beetles in beetle_space[1][1] will be considered as inhabiting the tree in tree_space[1,1]. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2) Actors\n",
      "\n",
      "#### a) Beetles\n",
      "Beetles are the main agent in this model which will spread outward from a randomly chosen focal point and degrade tree health to the point that the tree is killed. This model simulates their life cycle by stepping them through their life stages from egg to larvae to adult to dormant. Because reproduction is my main concern, I will only model female beetles. \n",
      "#### Properties\n",
      "* _lifestage_: What stage of life the beetle is in\n",
      "    * 1 = egg\n",
      "    * 2 = larvae\n",
      "    * 3 = dormant\n",
      "    * 4 = adult\n",
      "    * 5 = dead\n",
      "* _num_eggs_: the number of female eggs laid by a given female. Typical range is between 50 and 90 according to literature cited in proposal. Therefore, num_eggs will be based on a randomly sampling a uniform distribution between 25 and 45 (dividing by 2 to simulate only females). \n",
      "* _egg_survival_: this represents the probability that an egg becomes a larvae.\n",
      "* _winter_survival_: this represents the probability that a dormant lavae becomes an adult.\n",
      "* _wanderlust_: how far an adult beetle is willing to look for a new host tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "For their step function, beetles actions will vary depending on life stage. First, adult beetles will find new trees to inhabit and reproduce using the _find_and_inhabit_ module. Then, population dynamics will be simulated, depending on the lifestage of the beetle, as follows:\n",
      "* _Eggs_: Check _egg_survival_ to see whether egg becomes larvae or not.\n",
      "* _Larvae_ will feed on their host tree (degrading its health) and then become adults. If the host tree is unable to support it, the larvae will die.\n",
      "* _Dormant_ beetles will become adults. Some will not survive. \n",
      "* _Adults_ will search within their neighborhood (defined by _wanderlust_) for a new host tree. If they find one, they will lay eggs on it. Then they will die. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### b) Trees\n",
      "Trees are the other agent in this model. They will grow and die according to their interactions with beetles.\n",
      "#### Properties\n",
      "* _species_: whether the tree is an ash tree (and therefore a target) or not. \n",
      "* _tree_dbh_: the size (diameter at breast height) of the tree. This will affect how many larvae it can host.\n",
      "* _tree_health_: the health of the tree on a scale from 100 (perfectly healthy) to 0 (dead). \n",
      "* _has_beetles_: whether or not the tree is a host. This will only apply to ash trees, as other trees in the system will not be affected. \n",
      "* _num_eggs_: the number of female beetle eggs.\n",
      "* _num_larvae_: the number of female larva.\n",
      "* _num_dormant_: the number of female dormant beetles.\n",
      "* _num_adult_: the number of female adult beetles.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their step function, the following will update:\n",
      "* Trees will grow based on their health. If they are currently hosting beetles, they will not grow at all, but if they are not hosts, a nominal amount will be added to _tree_dbh_. \n",
      "* _tree_health_ will decline based on the number of adults/larvae on a given tree. This decline will be small in the presence of adults (they only defoliate the tree) but larger for each larvae present. Eventually, the tree will die. \n",
      "* If a previously unaffected tree becomes infested, _has_beetles_ will be updated. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Institutions\n",
      "At this time, this model has no institutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Initial Conditions\n",
      "### Trees\n",
      "* Trees will randomly be placed on a grid by sampling from a uniform discrete distribution with replacement. If we choose a cell that has already been chosen, we'll keep trying until we place all our trees.\n",
      "* Trees will then be assigned a species - randomly chosen trees from our population will become ash trees. \n",
      "* Trees will have their health randomly initialized to a value from a uniform continuous distribution between .85 and 1 (the majority of trees will be healthy at the outset). \n",
      "* Trees will have their size randomly initialized based on a uniform continuous distribution. \n",
      "* All trees will, by default, have no beetles. One will be randomly chosen to be infected with one adult. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Beetles\n",
      "* One dormant beetle will be placed on one ash tree. Then, in the first step, this beetle will become an adult who searches for a new tree to infest and subsequently, reproduces. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above description, we need the following:\n",
      "* _grid_size_: the size of our square 2D grid (i.e. square length)\n",
      "* _tree_population_: the total number of trees in our system.\n",
      "* _ash_prop_: the percentage of the tree population that is an ash species and therefore, susceptible. \n",
      "* _min_dbh_: the minimum dbh for trees in cm.\n",
      "* _max_dbh_: the maximum dbh for trees in cm. \n",
      "* _min_health_: the minimum health of a tree (0.85)\n",
      "* _max_health_: the maximum health of a tree (1) \n",
      "* _min_growth_: the minimum growth/timestep for a tree\n",
      "* _max_growth_: the maximum growth/timestep for a tree\n",
      "* _initial_beetles_: the number of beetles in the system at timestep 1. This defaults to 1. \n",
      "* _min_egg_survival_, _max_egg_survival_: the range of possible values of egg survival rates - varies between 0 and 1.\n",
      "* _min_winter_survival_, _max_winter_survival_: the range of possible values for winter survival rates - varies between 0 and 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Parameter Sweep Details\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to answer my question, I'll sweep tree density, tree health, and biodiversity (*tree_population*, *min_/max_tree_heath*, and *prop_ash*, respectively) to see how the Ash Borer spread rate is affected. Tree health will affect the length of time it takes for an ash borer infestation to kill a tree, and tree density/the proportion of ash trees will affect the ease with which the adult ash borers can find a suitable host. The model run for each set of parameters will stop once all ash trees in the study area (grid) have been killed. Then the number of timesteps that occurred will be counted and divided by four to quantify the number of years it took for the ash borer to decimate the ash population. By comparing these numbers, we can begin to see which factors affect Ash Borer spread rate, which could lead to management recommendations. \n",

      "\n",
      "With each simulation, I\u2019ll record the number of timesteps it took for all the ash trees in my simulated forest to be infected, which will tell me how well the initial parameters were able to curb EAB infestation rates. By sweeping model parameters over a large number of model runs, I can generalize spread rate for each parameter set and by comparing these spread rates, I can begin to draw conclusions about which spatial/environmental patterns are best able to slow EAB spread. \n",
      "\n",
      "To complete this analysis, I propose a Monte Carlo simulation, sweeping the tree density, biodiversity, and tree health parameters and drawing from a random sample of potential values for these variables of interest. While the experiment proposed above is a first-look, because I'm also tracking beetle population dynamics, there are many other in-depth analyses I could complete in the future.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the most effective way to view these results might be a 3d graph in which the x- and y- axes represent the array of parameter values that were swept and the z-axis corresponds to the average length of time for the model to stop (stopping condition = all trees dead).\n",

      "## Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "In this experiment, I wanted to discover how tree health, density, and biodiversity affected the rate of Ash Borer spread. I believe that I will find that decreased tree density, increased biodiversity, and increased tree health will result in slower spread rates and therefore, slower tree mortality. However, I expect that these things will not decrease spread rate by a very large margin, given the extremely efficient reproduction and spread of the Emerald Ash Borer, which has been proven to be particularly nasty and unstoppable across the eastern seaboard of the United States. \n",
