      "# Emerald Ash Borer ABM\n",
      "### Midterm Checkpoint: March 20, 2015\n",
      "### Becca Robinson\n",
      "* Course ID: CMPLXSYS 530\n",
      "* Course Title: Computer Modeling of Complex Systems\n",
      "* Term: Winter, 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "### Goal \n",
      "We will examine the effect of tree density, tree health, and biodiversity on the spread-rate of the Emerald Ash Borer. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Justification\n",
      "Given the variable behavior and life stages of the Emerald Ash Borer and the importance of spatial considerations when modeling their behavior, an ABM methodology is necessary. A Differential Equations approach would not be prudent in this case, given the relatively stochastic ways in which the Ash Borer is introduced and subsequently spreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Processes & Mechanisms of Interest\n",
      "In this model, I am primarily interested in the effects of tree density, tree health, and biodiversity on the spread-rate of the Emerald Ash Borer. To measure these effects, this model considers the length of time it takes for the entire tree population in the study area to be infected and killed by the Emerald Ash Borer. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Outline\n",
      "### 1) Space\n",
      "In this model, the space will be a 2D square grid without wrapping edges. Each grid cell will contain zero or one tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2) Actors\n",
      "\n",
      "#### a) Beetles\n",
      "Beetles are the main agent in this model which will spread outward from a randomly chosen focal point and degrade tree health to the point that the tree is killed. This model simulates their life cycle by stepping them through their life stages from egg to larvae to adult to dormant. Because reproduction is my main concern, I will only model female beetles. \n",
      "#### Properties\n",
      "* _lifestage_: What stage of life the beetle is in\n",
      "    * 1 = egg\n",
      "    * 2 = larvae\n",
      "    * 3 = dormant\n",
      "    * 4 = adult\n",
      "* _num_eggs_: the number of eggs laid by a given female. Typical range is between 40 and 70. This will only apply to adult beetles.\n",
      "* _egg_survival_: this represents the probability that an egg becomes a larvae.\n",
      "* _winter_survival_: this represents the probability that a dormant lavae becomes an adult.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their step function, beetles actions will vary depending on life stage:\n",
      "* _Eggs_: Check _egg_survival_ to see whether egg becomes larvae or not.\n",
      "* _Larvae_ will feed on their host tree (degrading its health) and then become adults. If the host tree is unable to support it, the larvae will die.\n",
      "* _Dormant_ beetles will become adults. Some will not survive. \n",
      "* _Adults_ will search within their neighborhood for a new host tree. If they find one, they will lay eggs on it. Then they will die. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### b) Trees\n",
      "Trees are the other agent in this model. They will grow and die according to their interactions with beetles.\n",
      "#### Properties\n",
      "* _species_: whether the tree is an ash tree (and therefore a target) or not. \n",
      "* _tree_dbh_: the size of the tree. This will affect how many larvae it can host.\n",
      "* _tree_health_: the health of the tree on a scale from 1 (perfectly healthy) to 0 (dead). \n",
      "* _has_beetles_: whether or not the tree is a host. This will only apply to ash trees, as other trees in the system will not be affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "For their step function, the following will update:\n",
      "* Trees will grow based on their health. If they are currently hosting beetles, they will not grow at all, but if they are not hosts, a nominal amount will be added to _tree_dbh_. \n",
      "* _tree_health_ will decline based on the number of adults/larvae on a given tree. This decline will be small in the presence of adults (they only defoliate the tree) but larger for each larvae present. Eventually, the tree will die. \n",
      "* If a previously unaffected tree becomes infested, _has_beetles_ will be updated. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Institutions\n",
      "At this time, this model has no institutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Initial Conditions\n",
      "### Trees\n",
      "* Trees will randomly be placed on a grid by sampling from a uniform discrete distribution with replacement. If we choose a cell that has already been chosen, we'll keep trying until we place all our trees (based on _tree_population_)\n",
      "* Trees will then be assigned a species - randomly chosen trees from our population will become ash trees. (based on ash_prop)\n",
      "* Trees will have their health randomly initialized to a value from a right-skewed distribution (the majority of trees will be healthy at the outset). \n",
      "* Trees will have their size randomly initialized based on a uniform continuous distribution. \n",
      "* All trees will, by default, have no beetles. One will be randomly chosen to be infected. \n",
      "\n",
